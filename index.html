                   <P> Mexico City is, and has always been, the sun in the Mexican solar system. Though much-maligned in the past, these days the city is cleaning up its act. Revamped public spaces are springing back to life, the culinary scene is exploding and a cultural renaissance is flourishing. On top of all that, by largely managing to distance itself from the drug war, the nation’s capital remains a safe haven of sorts. </P>

               <P class="font-style" > SCUBA DIVING TIPS FOR BEGINNERS </P>

               <p>  (1)BREATHE NORMALLY:
                My best tip for beginner divers is just to breathe normally. Don’t hold your breath, don’t hyperventilate, just breathe normally. Like you would on land. If you’re a little nervous about diving, controlling your breathing will help to calm you down. Normal breathing also helps to control your buoyancy, and because you consume less air when your breathing is slow and controlled, your air supply lasts longer so you can dive for longer. Breathing out of a regulator (the mouthpiece that feeds you oxygen) feels a bit different at first, but you quickly get used to it. It’s also good to know that the air you breathe underwater is exactly the same as what you breathe on land – nothing fancy, just plain old air!  </P>

             <p>    2) DO EVERYTHING SLOWLY:
                One of the golden rules of diving is that everything should be done slowly – that includes your breathing, your movement, and your ascent and descent. When you flap around and try to do everything quickly, it’s easy to get yourself worked up, scare off wildlife and consume more air and energy. Diving is definitely not a fast sport. Don’t ever feel pressure to do anything fast – just take it easy and go at your own pace. Going slow is especially important when you’re coming up to the surface because you need to allow your body to adjust to the pressure change. Doing everything slowly also allows you to take in your surroundings and appreciate where you are. </P>

             <p>    3) EQUALIZE REGULARLY:
            Just like you have to equalize your ears when you go on a plane, you need to equalize your ears when you dive. The purpose of equalizing is to match the pressure inside your ears with the pressure in your outside environment (i.e. the ocean). You can equalize your ears by pinching your nose and gently blowing, by swallowing, or adopting any other method that feels most comfortable. Never forcefully try to equalize your ears, and if your ears ever feel painful, tell your instructor immediately and he/she will guide you. Chewing gum before the dive (not during!) will help to loosen up your ears, and I recommend equalizing every minute or so, or possibly more frequently depending how quickly you’re descending. You can never equalize too often (I do it very often), so it’s good to get into the habit of doing it. </p>
