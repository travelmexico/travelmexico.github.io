   	  <h2>True Flavors Of Mexican Food </h2>
   	  <p> If you think that Taco Bell is great Mexican food, you are truly missing out. Authentic Mexican food is a rich, enchanting mix of flavor, color and texture; its presentation is as important as its taste. With a diverse history, Mexicoâ€™s cultural heritage began with the native Aztec Indian tribes and was touched by Spain, France and, eventually, America. Likewise, Mexican food inherited these same diverse influences.</p>

      <p> Authentic Mexican food is a broad term used for many of the traditional dishes. But the word "authentic" can be misleading. Many chain restaurants claim to serve authentic Mexican food. What that really means for the foodies of this world is that the spices used in flavoring the dish are authentic to Mexico, though the methods used and even the ingredients themselves may not be as genuine as they claim. For the most part, "authentic" refers to dishes that have traditionally been prepared in Mexico for the last 50 or more years. A lot of the Mexican food served today is very much Americanized, and some even bears its regional influence such as TexMex.</p>

      <p> There are, however, many ways to identify and enjoy authentic Mexican food, from the spicy flavors and simple ingredients to the careful preparation. Read on for an understanding of what makes Mexican food truly authentic.</p>
